    We use the named Joint Modeling method for entity recognition and intent detection. This to say,wo used only
model to labeling the slot as well as detecting the intent of the specific task.
    We used the Bi_LSTM to modeling our model. Wo just concat each time output of the forward and back forward
of the the cell(we used LSTMCell, but can also use the basicLSTM cell), and then each time concat forward to crf
the for slot recognition.The output of crf layer is a set of indexes of the slots. Example, assumed the row text is
'BOS flights from ontario to florida EOS'(from atis),then the output of crf layer is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0], then we
quickly lookup the dict of all slots and finally find that '0' means nothing, '1' is the index of a slot named
'B-fromloc.city_name', and '2' is the index of 'B-toloc.city_name'. So we get all slots and the corresponding row word of
the original input, obviously,'{{'B-fromloc.city_name': 'ontario'}, {'B-toloc.city_name': 'florida'}}'.
    For intent detection, wo just used the last time concat output of forward and back forward direction of Bi_LSTM to
predict the correct intent of the row text.
